# backdash-macro
an autohotkey macro that automatically does backdash cancel for you.


## What is this for?
Usually, people macroing backdash cancel would use a program called "MacroGamer"
Although using MacroGamer is easier, it doesn't have much features and customizablity.
This is why I've created my own version using autohotkey.

> [!TIP]
> Keybinds below are my own preferred set. Feel free to change the keybinds in the script

## Key Features
- Any type of user input such as holding the S key or the W key would not affect the execution of the backdash cancel, this allows for more freedom during backdash cancel
- In spite of the fact that using DLLCalls for sleep timing is unnecessary, I decided why not? and such, this script uses DLLCalls (highprecisionsleep) for... high precision delay...
- A Suspend/Unsuspend hotkey! You would have to manually open MacroGamer and stop the macro itself from running. Not with this one.

## Prerequirements
 
In order to actually run the script, you would need [Autohotkey v2]{https://www.autohotkey.com/} and a functioning keyboard.

### Keybinds

- E = 3rd move
- R = 2nd move
- T = 1st move
- C = 4th move
