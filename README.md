# backdash-macro
an autohotkey macro that automatically does backdash cancel for you.


# What is this for?
Usually, people macroing backdash cancel would use a program called "MacroGamer"
Although using MacroGamer is easier, it doesn't have much features and customizablity.
This is why I've created my own version using autohotkey.

# Key Features
- Any type of user input such as holding the S key or the W key would not affect the execution of the backdash cancel, this allows for more freedom during backdash cancel
- In spite of the fact that using DLLCalls for sleep timing is unnecessary, I decided why not? and such, this script uses DLLCalls (highprecisionsleep) for... high precision delay...
- A Suspend/Unsuspend hotkey! You would have to manually open MacroGamer and stop the macro itself from running.

# Prerequirements

I've customized the keybinds to my own personal preference but feel free to change them to however you want.
In order to actually run the script, you would need autohotkey v2 and a functioning keyboard.

# Keybinds

E = 3rd move
R = 2nd move
T = 1st move
C = 4th move
