# backdash-macro
an autohotkey macro that automatically does backdash cancel for you.


## Overview
clutter free backdash cancel macro

## Key Features
- **Uninterupted user handling**:    Holding any movement key would not interrupt the macro, effectively deminishing any possible conflict or error during execution.

- **High-precision timing**:         In spite of the fact that using DLLCalls for sleep timing is unnecessary, I added it anyways. Falls back to sleep if DLLCall doesn't work somehow.

- **A Suspend/Unsuspend hotkey!**    You would have to manually open MacroGamer and stop the macro itself from running, quite obnoxious in my opinion


## Pre-requirements
To run this script, you would need the following:

- [AutoHotkey v2](https://autohotkey.com)


## Installation

To install, simply head over to the [release](https://github.com/yxnc/backdash-macro/releases) page and choose which version you want.

## Usage



Run **macro.ahk** or **debug.ahk** with AutoHotkey v2



### Keybinds


> [!NOTE]
> Keybinds below are my own preferred set. Feel free to modify the keybinds to your preference

- 'R' = Does backdash cancel for the 2nd move
